## Whatsminer Log Visualizer

A Python program to visualize the 'miner-state' and 'long-miner-state' logs from a Whatsminertool log export

## Usage

Clicking on the Batch file automatically starts the program (as long as Python 3.11 is installed). After the program is started, you can then click
the button 'Select File' and select the 'miner-state' or 'long-miner-state' logs from the .tgz file extracted from the miner. Then you can click the button 'Graph Data,'
which will open a matplotlib graph window showing different data points from the miner.
